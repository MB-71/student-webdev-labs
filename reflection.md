## Reflection Document

### HTML

The HTML exercises were pretty straight forward. Utilizing the class resources (.ppt slides) and documentation found from MDN made the exercises relatively simple. I noticed that the images exercise, the placepuppy.com was not working for me, as such, the alternate text is shown. For issues, the form exercise was slightly difficult in trying to properly format the form. I settled on utilizing `<br>` in the document to have the spacing between elements. Utilized Chrome for checking, via Live Server.

### Accessibility

The a11y tasks were relatively straightforward, some of the form led me to fix some issues on the html ativity.

### CSS

Learned a lot about CSS specifics that I was not necessarily familiar with. How specific elements and items can be stylized is interesting. I felt I would get somewhat lost on some of the heirarchies in attempting to change a specific item.

### Flexbox

Need more practice easily identifying what flex direction I would need to use in the exercises. Very useful information in regards to flex and how things are anchored.

### Grid

Intersting in the different CSS layout for grids, not something that I would have initially thought of (mostly in regards to grid-areas).

### Bootstrap

It seems convienient to have everything bootstrapped and not have custom elements. For a side project, I made custom elements throughout the website, utilizing different
style sheets and utilizing pages.

### js

Still new to javascript, so the functions inside methods is somewhat new to me. I think my side project website was spaghetti code of js and html. Will have to revisit and adjust
it utilizing a better understanding.
