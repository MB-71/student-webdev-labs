## Reflection Document

### HTML

The HTML exercises were pretty straight forward. Utilizing the class resources (.ppt slides) and documentation found from MDN made the exercises relatively simple. I noticed that the images exercise, the placepuppy.com was not working for me, as such, the alternate text is shown. For issues, the form exercise was slightly difficult in trying to properly format the form. I settled on utilizing `<br>` in the document to have the spacing between elements. Utilized Chrome for checking, via Live Server.

### Accessibility

The a11y tasks were relatively straightforward, some of the form led me to fix some issues on the html ativity.

### CSS

Learned a lot about CSS specifics that I was not necessarily familiar with. How specific elements and items can be stylized is interesting. I felt I would get somewhat lost on some of the heirarchies in attempting to change a specific item.

### Flexbox
